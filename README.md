🐦 The ESP Birdie

A $5 Microchip That Learns Bird Songs – Totally Offline!

https://www.instructables.com/Smarter-Than-You-Think-DIY-AI-Bird-Detector-on-ESP/



Have you ever wondered what kind of birds are singing in your garden?
At what time of day or season they appear?

But then you checked out the "smart" solutions online – only to find cloud-based overcomplicated services, subscriptions, and the need to share your data (and accept a cookie just to begin)?
Yeah… I’m not a fan either. That’s why I decided to build my own solution – from scratch, and completely offline. 
No internet, no cloud, no subscription, no data harvesting.

I built a device that teaches itself.
It listens, learns, and retrains overnight – getting better every day.
In an age where everyone just copies and pastes cloud-based AI tools, there’s little challenge left.

This project (like my previous one gridshell) brings back the maker’s spirit.
It shows that you can build useful, clever tech by yourself – and make it truly yours.

🔌 It costs nothing to run.

 🌐 It requires zero internet.
 
 🧠 It uses real machine learning – on a chip the size of your thumb.
 
 🕊️ It identifies birds, live, in real time.



ESP32 Birdie is a blend of creative coding and outside-the-box engineering. It demonstrates the power of a $5 microchip with just a microphone – turning it into an intelligent, independent sound classifier.

Break the link to the cloud.
Take back control.
And let your device do the thinking.

It’s your model, your data, your rules – running right on your ESP32.
